# MadzLab MaDev ( Mad Web3 Development ) Tool

## Pourpose
The pourpose of this tool is to provide a Web3 developer with a quick and convenient way of deploying an EVM compatible blockchain 
with some additional stuff like Blockscout and The Graph for example.      

## How to use - WIP
Just clone the repo and run `go run main.go` to bootstrap and start `Polygon Edge` blockchain.    
Some fixes are on the way and adding Blockscout and The Graph as well.
